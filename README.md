# Prodigy Info Tech - Machine Learning Internship Task 01   
## 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various input features using a machine learning model. 
It is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## 📌 Project Overview 
The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the price of houses.  
Based on input features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. The project includes:  
-  Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation using Linear Regression
- Prediction visualization

## 📁 Dataset  
Dataset used:https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data  
The dataset contains housing data with features like:  
- Location  
- Size in square feet  
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- Price (target variable)
